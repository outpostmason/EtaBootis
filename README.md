# EtaBootis
2nd outpost in the Eta Bootis star-system by outpostmason

A number of concepts for design and gridding are layed into these files. Reference links will be updated to assist with furthe rself development. I come from the music world so much of this may be unorganized. but for the advanced user, you will see subgridding, card and container elements and a unifrom skelton for positioning not only page layout but content and style as well. This boiler is a result of alot of repition of the same concepts in no unique order. The web runs mainly on html, CSS, & Java. I would encourage all new users to start with a basic duplication of a Github account and website like this as a first landing spot in the big univers that also is technology. 

This code includes SOME java and all funcitons are listed so they can be duplicated, re-purposed, or removed. 
Please visit and support artist links before deleting them from your projects or throughout your development as background music etc. These are the people who made ceating more fun in my life and a gift like this is Teimless.
